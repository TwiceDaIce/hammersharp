# Hammer#

At first, there was C. And then C++. And finally, C#.
We've had Hammer. Hammer++. Naturally, we needed Hammer#. (Or Hammer++++, if you prefer.)

Hammer# is a modern and flexible mapping toolkit for Source Enging mappers.

> **Modern**: built on top of the .NET MAUI framework, providing a native and responsive cross-platform experience.

> **Flexible**: no two builds of Source are the same. Hammer# is built with backwards compatibility in mind.
